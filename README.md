UW CSE 573 Final Project

The Vegas project is a blackjack simulator along with a variety of learning-based and non learning-based agents capable of playing it. To get started, download the code and then run "python game.py --help" to see the required and optional arguments to the simulator. Agents must be specified via the -p flag, and all agents are contained in files ending with _agent, such as the QLearningAgent and ValueIterationAgent, which are contained in q_learning_agent.py and value_iteration_agent.py, respectively.
